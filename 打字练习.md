	typing is quite easy and enjoyable when you have learned to do it correctly. it is amazing just how quick you can be when you learn to touch type all the letters exactly, from a to z. 
	just relax and realize that typing with excellent accuracy is far better than typing fast; you will find it is quicker in the end.
